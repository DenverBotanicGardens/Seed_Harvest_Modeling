# Seed Harvest Modeling    
  
  
## Test the 10% rule for ex-situ seed conservation without harming rare plant populations.   
  

Goals:  
  
  * What are life history traits that correspond to an increase in extinction risk or decrease in stochastic lambda from various seed harvest frequency and intensity?  
  

  
Empirical data:  
  
  * Determine typical life-history traits
  * Develop estimates of parameters from categories of plant types including correlations among growth and reproductive paramenters. Mimic the estimates and variability of real examples.
