Example data for Sclerocactus glaucus where size measurements are the width at widest point for these ball cacti
't0' and 't1' are the widths (cm) and survival is for the tagged cactus from year t to t+1. 'reproyesno' is for 't0'. 'flowers0' is a Poisson distribution based on a linear model of number of flowers by size on the one year we took that data. 'minis0' and 'minis1' are the number of seedlings (cacti with < 0.5 cm in width) in year t and t+1
